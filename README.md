# Playground monorepo

## Development

Development is done via docker dev container, so run

```
your-system$ docker-compose up -d
```

and then connect to it with VSCode extension.

Then you use nx to run and develop apps/libs, like that

```
inside-container$ pnpm nx run example-webpack-app:serve
```

Or proceed to app/lib directory readme:

apps:

1. [example-webpack-app](1.apps/example-webpack-app/README.md)

libs:

1. [example-ts-lib](2.libs.example-ts-lib/README.md)
